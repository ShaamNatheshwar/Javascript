// basics of java script 
// commenting
alert("Hello_world") it is done by using two forward slashes



// data types
// variables
// variables are box tht are used to store a value let be any of 7 data types
// variables can be called by 3 ways
var myName = "shaam"
// var will remain same over entire programming , also it can be changed.
let herName = "SSS"
 // the sad thing abt let is it can't be changed and it is only in a place where it is generated
const pi = 3.14
// even constant can't be changed once intiated its done



// declaring and assigning variables
// declaring a variable 
var a;
// assigning a variable
console.log(a)
var b = 190;
// tht is we will assign using an assignment operator
a = 7;
a = b;
console.log(a)



//camel casing 
var shaamNatheshwar = 18;
console.log(ShaamNatheshwar) //this is wrong coz case sensitivity.



/* basic arithmetic operators in javascript */
/* add */
var sum = 100 + 20;
console.log(sum)
/* subract */
var sub = 100 - 20;
console.log(sub);
/* multiply */
var mul = 100*2;
console.log(mul);
/* divide */
var div = 100/10;
console.log(div);



/* incrementing a number */
var myVar = 99;
myVar++;
console.log(myVar);
/* decrenenting a number */
var myTar = 99;
myVar--;
console.log(myTar);



/* decimal numbers
javascript also uses decimal number */
mySar = 0.008;
console.log(mySar);
// same multiplication and divison rules are applied to decimals



//easier number add on
var a = 3;
var b = 2;
var c = 2;
a += 12;
b += 10;
c += 5;
console.log(a,b,c)
// same steps can be followed for division sub mul make sure tht we use the assign operator in the last



/* strings */
var myName = "Shaam"
var myName2 = "Nath"
console.log(myName)



/* ignoring nested double quotes */
var harry = "The death spell is \"Avarakedavra\"it is deadly"
console.log(harry)
/* in this case use backslash to get rid of nested quotes */
/* use either single quotes or even back quotes if u feel this method is difficult */



/* concatenation */
var myName = "shaam"+" natheshwar";
console.log(myName)



/* concatenation */
var myName = "shaam"+" natheshwar";

console.log(myName)



/* finding length of string */
var myName = "shaamNatheshwar";
console.log(myName.length)



/* index in    here the indexing is done using square brackets
also indices start from o which is called zero based indexing */
var myName = "shaamNatheshwar";
console.log(myName[0])
console.log(myName[1])
console.log(myName[2])
console.log(myName[3])
console.log(myName[4])


//strings are always immutable
var myName = "jhaam natheshwar";
//we cant directly chnge by indexing so we can change the entire stuff
myName = "shaam natheshwar";



 /* arrays are used to store a data */
var myArr = ["shaam",7]
//they always use a square bracket which is followed by a comma



//array inside another array is a nested array
var myNr = [["shaam",18],["virat",31]];



/* indexing of arrays */

/* strings are immutable whereas arrays aren't  they can be changed*/

/* accessing multiple array use multiple indices */

/* use push attribute to push stuffs at the end
 */var myVar = [1,2,3];

console.log(myVar)



/* use pop attribute to remove stuffs at the end
 */var myVar = [1,2,3];

/* use shift attribute to remove first stuff*/
var myVar = [1,2,3];
myVar.shift();
console.log(myVar)



/* use unshift attribute to adds to the first stuff*/
var myVar = [1,2,3];

/* functions are really important like other programming language they need to be called for there proper functioning */

function first(){
	console.log("hello,world");
}
first()

/* the things to remember in a function is tht first use function attribute then the
string and in bracket write stuffs to be invoked then open parenthesos write the stuffs u wanna execute then callem */



//functions with operations
function myFirst(a,b){
	console.log(a-b);
}
myFirst(100,99)

//u can use any argument inside the bracket make sure tht we call em
another important thing to be noticed is var above a function is termed as a global also if u wanna make any function globall just dont contain it in a var
